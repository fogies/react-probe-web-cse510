## Installation

- Requires Node:

  <https://nodejs.org/> 

- Ensure Yarn is globally installed:

  <https://yarnpkg.com/>

  ```shell script
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

- Install packages:

  ```shell script
  yarn install
  ```

## Execution

- Build and serve, available at `http://localhost:3000`:

  ```shell script
  yarn start
  ```

  Many changes will be automatically updated in the browser, 
  but not all changes and so a browser refresh is sometimes necessary.

  Browser refresh is currently only supported at the root.
