# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
It is based in a combination of readings and discussion, a small statistics lab, and a self-defined project.
The course readings will require preparing reports on a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
This will help you examine what the HCI community considers a research contribution across a variety of problems,
thus preparing you to understand and make meaningful research contributions in these and other areas of HCI.

This course is explicitly not focused on the design methods commonly used in HCI practice.
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite),
but students seeking an introduction to effective design or the design process will be better served by CSE 440.

The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities. 
You might choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology, 
or you might choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.

We will emphasize open discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and be able to differentiate forms of research contribution in HCI
- Gain understanding of prior fundamental results that now frame areas of HCI research
- Gain understanding of articulating new contributions in such areas of HCI research
- Gain understanding of common HCI research methods

          Problem is there's no margin collapse for a flexbox.
          Tried to remove margin on children with nested selector,
          but no nested selector appeared to have any effect.
          Settled for manually-determined negative margins on the root Box.
          Set negative margin to same as <p>, effectively collapsing those. -->

## Grading

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Readings and Reading Reports
- 45%: Group Project
  - 5%: Proposal Document and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report
- 10%: Statistics Lab
- 15%: Exam
- 10%: Participation

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like guidance in this regard.

Project milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
Final project report grading will then consider overall execution.
